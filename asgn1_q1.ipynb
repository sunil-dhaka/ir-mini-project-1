[ 11 ] over 97 % of websit use javascript on the client side for web page behavior , [ 12 ] often incorpor third-parti librari . [ 13 ] all major web browser have a dedic javascript engin to execut the code on user ' devic . javascript is a high-level , often just-in-tim compil languag that conform to the ecmascript standard . [ 14 ] It ha dynam type , prototype-bas object-orient , and first-class function . It is multi-paradigm , support event-driven , function , and imper program style . It ha applic program interfac ( api ) for work with text , date , regular express , standard data structur , and the document object model ( dom ) . the ecmascript standard doe not includ ani input/output ( i/o ) , such as network , storag , or graphic facil . In practic , the web browser or other runtim system provid javascript api for i/o . javascript engin were origin use onli in web browser , but are now core compon of some server and a varieti of applic . the most popular runtim system for thi usag is node.j . although java and javascript are similar in name , syntax , and respect standard librari , the two languag are distinct and differ greatli in design . content 1 histori 1.1 creation at netscap 1.2 adopt by microsoft 1.3 the rise of jscript 1.4 growth and standard 1.5 reach matur 2 trademark 3 websit client-sid usag 3.1 exampl of script behavior 3.2 librari and framework 4 other usag 5 featur 5.1 imper and structur 5.2 weakli type 5.3 dynam 5.4 object-orient ( prototype-bas ) 5.5 function 5.6 deleg 5.7 miscellan 5.8 vendor-specif extens 6 syntax 6.1 simpl exampl 6.2 more advanc exampl 7 secur 7.1 cross-sit vulner 7.2 misplac trust in the client 7.3 misplac trust in develop 7.4 browser and plugin code error 7.5 sandbox implement error 7.6 hardwar vulner 8 develop tool 9 relat technolog 9.1 java 9.2 json 9.3 webassembl 9.4 transpil 10 refer 11 further read 12 extern link histori [ edit ] creation at netscap [ edit ] the first web browser with a graphic user interfac , mosaic , wa releas in 1993 . access to non-techn peopl , it play a promin role in the rapid growth of the nascent world wide web . [ 15 ] the lead develop of mosaic then found the netscap corpor , which releas a more polish browser , netscap navig , in 1994 . thi quickli becam the most-us . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] dure these form year of the web , web page could onli be static , lack the capabl for dynam behavior after the page wa load in the browser . there wa a desir in the burgeon web develop scene to remov thi limit , so in 1995 , netscap decid to add a script languag to navig . they pursu two rout to achiev thi : collabor with sun microsystem to emb the java program languag , while also hire brendan eich to emb the scheme languag . [ 6 ] netscap manag soon decid that the best option wa for eich to devis a new languag , with syntax similar to java and less like scheme or other extant script languag . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] although the new languag and it interpret implement were call livescript when first ship as part of a navig beta in septemb 1995 , the name wa chang to javascript for the offici releas in decemb . [ 6 ] [ 1 ] [ 18 ] the choic of the javascript name ha caus confus , impli that it is directli relat to java . At the time , the dot-com boom had begun and java wa the hot new languag , so eich consid the javascript name a market ploy by netscap . [ 19 ] adopt by microsoft [ edit ] microsoft debut internet explor in 1995 , lead to a browser war with netscap . On the javascript front , microsoft reverse-engin the navig interpret to creat it own , call jscript . [ 20 ] jscript wa first releas in 1996 , alongsid initi support for css and extens to html . each of these implement wa notic differ from their counterpart in navig . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] these differ made it difficult for develop to make their websit work well in both browser , lead to widespread use of `` best view in netscap '' and `` best view in internet explor '' logo for sever year . [ 21 ] [ 23 ] the rise of jscript [ edit ] In novemb 1996 , netscap submit javascript to ecma intern , as the start point for a standard specif that all browser vendor could conform to . thi led to the offici releas of the first ecmascript languag specif in june 1997 . the standard process continu for a few year , with the releas of ecmascript 2 in june 1998 and ecmascript 3 in decemb 1999 . work on ecmascript 4 began in 2000 . [ 20 ] meanwhil , microsoft gain an increasingli domin posit in the browser market . By the earli 2000 , internet explor 's market share reach 95 % . [ 24 ] thi meant that jscript becam the de facto standard for client-sid script on the web . microsoft initi particip in the standard process and implement some propos in it jscript languag , but eventu it stop collabor on ecma work . thu ecmascript 4 wa mothbal . growth and standard [ edit ] dure the period of internet explor domin in the earli 2000 , client-sid script wa stagnant . thi start to chang in 2004 , when the successor of netscap , mozilla , releas the firefox browser . firefox wa well receiv by mani , take signific market share from internet explor . [ 25 ] In 2005 , mozilla join ecma intern , and work start on the ecmascript for xml ( e4x ) standard . thi led to mozilla work jointli with macromedia ( later acquir by adob system ) , who were implement e4x in their actionscript 3 languag , which wa base on an ecmascript 4 draft . the goal becam standard actionscript 3 as the new ecmascript 4 . To thi end , adob system releas the tamarin implement as an open sourc project . howev , tamarin and actionscript 3 were too differ from establish client-sid script , and without cooper from microsoft , ecmascript 4 never reach fruition . meanwhil , veri import develop were occur in open-sourc commun not affili with ecma work . In 2005 , jess jame garrett releas a white paper in which he coin the term ajax and describ a set of technolog , of which javascript wa the backbon , to creat web applic where data can be load in the background , avoid the need for full page reload . thi spark a renaiss period of javascript , spearhead by open-sourc librari and the commun that form around them . mani new librari were creat , includ jqueri , prototyp , dojo toolkit , and mootool . googl debut it chrome browser in 2008 , with the V8 javascript engin that wa faster than it competit . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] the key innov wa just-in-tim compil ( jit ) , [ 28 ] so other browser vendor need to overhaul their engin for jit . [ 29 ] In juli 2008 , these dispar parti came togeth for a confer in oslo . thi led to the eventu agreement in earli 2009 to combin all relev work and drive the languag forward . the result wa the ecmascript 5 standard , releas in decemb 2009 . reach matur [ edit ] ambiti work on the languag continu for sever year , culmin in an extens collect of addit and refin be formal with the public of ecmascript 6 in 2015 . [ 30 ] the creation of node.j in 2009 by ryan dahl spark a signific increas in the usag of javascript outsid of web browser . node combin the V8 engin , an event loop , and i/o api , therebi provid a stand-alon javascript runtim system . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] As of 2018 , node had been use by million of develop , [ 33 ] and npm had the most modul of ani packag manag in the world . [ 34 ] the ecmascript draft specif is current maintain openli on github , and edit are produc via regular annual snapshot . [ 35 ] potenti revis to the languag are vet through a comprehens propos process . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] now , instead of edit number , develop check the statu of upcom featur individu . [ 35 ] the current javascript ecosystem ha mani librari and framework , establish program practic , and substanti usag of javascript outsid of web browser . plu , with the rise of single-pag applic and other javascript-heavi websit , sever transpil have been creat to aid the develop process . [ 38 ] trademark [ edit ] '' javascript '' is a trademark of oracl corpor in the unit state . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] websit client-sid usag [ edit ] javascript is the domin client-sid script languag of the web , with 97 % of websit use it for thi purpos . [ 12 ] script are embed in or includ from html document and interact with the dom . all major web browser have a built-in javascript engin that execut the code on the user 's devic . exampl of script behavior [ edit ] load new web page content without reload the page , via ajax or a websocket . for exampl , user of social media can send and receiv messag without leav the current page . web page anim , such as fade object in and out , resiz , and move them . play browser game . control the playback of stream media . gener pop-up ad . valid input valu of a web form befor the data is sent to a web server . log data about the user 's behavior then send it to a server . the websit owner can use thi data for analyt , ad track , and person . redirect a user to anoth page . librari and framework [ edit ] over 80 % of websit use a third-parti javascript librari or web framework for their client-sid script . [ 13 ] jqueri is by far the most popular librari , use by over 75 % of websit . [ 13 ] facebook creat the react librari for it websit and later releas it as open sourc ; other site , includ twitter , now use it . likewis , the angular framework creat by googl for it websit , includ youtub and gmail , is now an open sourc project use by other . [ 13 ] In contrast , the term `` vanilla JS '' ha been coin for websit not use ani librari or framework , instead reli entir on standard javascript function . [ 41 ] other usag [ edit ] the use of javascript ha expand beyond it web browser root . javascript engin are now embed in a varieti of other softwar system , both for server-sid websit deploy and non-brows applic . initi attempt at promot server-sid javascript usag were netscap enterpris server and microsoft 's internet inform servic , [ 42 ] [ 43 ] but they were small nich . [ 44 ] server-sid usag eventu start to grow in the late 2000 , with the creation of node.j and other approach . [ 44 ] electron , cordova , react nativ , and other applic framework have been use to creat mani applic with behavior implement in javascript . other non-brows applic includ adob acrobat support for script pdf document [ 45 ] and gnome shell extens written in javascript . [ 46 ] javascript ha recent begun to appear in some embed system , usual by leverag node.j . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] featur [ edit ] the follow featur are common to all conform ecmascript implement unless explicitli specifi otherwis . imper and structur [ edit ] javascript support much of the structur program syntax from C ( e.g. , if statement , while loop , switch statement , do while loop , etc. ) . one partial except is scope : origin javascript onli had function scope with var ; then block scope wa ad in ecmascript 2015 with the keyword let and const . like C , javascript make a distinct between express and statement . one syntact differ from C is automat semicolon insert , which allow semicolon ( which termin statement ) to be omit . [ 50 ] weakli type [ edit ] javascript is weakli type , which mean certain type are implicitli cast depend on the oper use . [ 51 ] the binari + oper cast both operand to a string unless both operand are number . thi is becaus the addit oper doubl as a concaten oper the binari - oper alway cast both operand to a number both unari oper ( + , - ) alway cast the operand to a number valu are cast to string like the follow : [ 51 ] string are left as-i number are convert to their string represent array have their element cast to string after which they are join by comma ( , ) other object are convert to the string [ object object ] where object is the name of the constructor of the object valu are cast to number by cast to string and then cast the string to number . these process can be modifi by defin tostr and valueof function on the prototyp for string and number cast respect . javascript ha receiv critic for the way it implement these convers as the complex of the rule can be mistaken for inconsist . [ 52 ] [ 51 ] for exampl , when ad a number to a string , the number will be cast to a string befor perform concaten , but when subtract a number from a string , the string is cast to a number befor perform subtract . javascript type convers left operand oper right operand result [ ] ( empti array ) + [ ] ( empti array ) '' '' ( empti string ) [ ] ( empti array ) + { } ( empti object ) '' [ object object ] '' ( string ) fals ( boolean ) + [ ] ( empti array ) '' fals '' ( string ) '' 123 '' ( string ) + 1 ( number ) '' 1231 '' ( string ) '' 123 '' ( string ) - 1 ( number ) 122 ( number ) '' 123 '' ( string ) - '' abc '' ( string ) nan ( number ) often also mention is { } + [ ] result in 0 ( number ) . thi is mislead : the { } is interpret as an empti code block instead of an empti object , and the empti array is cast to a number by the remain unari + oper . If you wrap the express in parenthes ( { } + [ ] ) the curli bracket are interpret as an empti object and the result of the express is `` [ object object ] '' as expect . [ 51 ] dynam [ edit ] type javascript is dynam type like most other script languag . A type is associ with a valu rather than an express . for exampl , a variabl initi bound to a number may be reassign to a string . [ 53 ] javascript support variou way to test the type of object , includ duck type . [ 54 ] run-tim evalu javascript includ an eval function that can execut statement provid as string at run-tim . object-orient ( prototype-bas ) [ edit ] prototyp inherit in javascript is describ by dougla crockford as : .mw-parser-output .templatequot { overflow : hidden ; margin:1em 0 ; padding:0 40px } .mw-parser-output .templatequot .templatequotecit { line-height:1.5em ; text-align : left ; padding-left:1.6em ; margin-top:0 } you make prototyp object , and then ... make new instanc . object are mutabl in javascript , so we can augment the new instanc , give them new field and method . these can then act as prototyp for even newer object . We do n't need class to make lot of similar object ... object inherit from object . what could be more object orient than that ? [ 55 ] In javascript , an object is an associ array , augment with a prototyp ( see below ) ; each key provid the name for an object properti , and there are two syntact way to specifi such a name : dot notat ( obj.xâ =Â 10 ) and bracket notat ( obj [ ' x ' ] Â =Â 10 ) . A properti may be ad , rebound , or delet at run-tim . most properti of an object ( and ani properti that belong to an object 's prototyp inherit chain ) can be enumer use a for ... in loop . prototyp javascript use prototyp where mani other object-ori languag use class for inherit . [ 56 ] It is possibl to simul mani class-bas featur with prototyp in javascript . [ 57 ] function as object constructor function doubl as object constructor , along with their typic role . prefix a function call with new will creat an instanc of a prototyp , inherit properti and method from the constructor ( includ properti from the object prototyp ) . [ 58 ] ecmascript 5 offer the object.cr method , allow explicit creation of an instanc without automat inherit from the object prototyp ( older environ can assign the prototyp to null ) . [ 59 ] the constructor 's prototyp properti determin the object use for the new object 's intern prototyp . new method can be ad by modifi the prototyp of the function use as a constructor . javascript 's built-in constructor , such as array or object , also have prototyp that can be modifi . while it is possibl to modifi the object prototyp , it is gener consid bad practic becaus most object in javascript will inherit method and properti from the object prototyp , and they may not expect the prototyp to be modifi . [ 60 ] function as method unlik mani object-ori languag , there is no distinct between a function definit and a method definit . rather , the distinct occur dure function call ; when a function is call as a method of an object , the function 's local thi keyword is bound to that object for that invoc . function [ edit ] A function is first-class ; a function is consid to be an object . [ 61 ] As such , a function may have properti and method , such as .call ( ) and .bind ( ) . [ 62 ] A nest function is a function defin within anoth function . It is creat each time the outer function is invok . In addit , each nest function form a lexic closur : the lexic scope of the outer function ( includ ani constant , local variabl , or argument valu ) becom part of the intern state of each inner function object , even after execut of the outer function conclud . [ 63 ] javascript also support anonym function . deleg [ edit ] javascript support implicit and explicit deleg . function as role ( trait and mixin ) javascript nativ support variou function-bas implement of role [ 64 ] pattern like trait [ 65 ] [ 66 ] and mixin . [ 67 ] such a function defin addit behavior by at least one method bound to the thi keyword within it function bodi . A role then ha to be deleg explicitli via call or appli to object that need to featur addit behavior that is not share via the prototyp chain . object composit and inherit wherea explicit function-bas deleg doe cover composit in javascript , implicit deleg alreadi happen everi time the prototyp chain is walk in order to , e.g. , find a method that might be relat to but is not directli own by an object . onc the method is found it get call within thi object 's context . thu inherit in javascript is cover by a deleg automat that is bound to the prototyp properti of constructor function . miscellan [ edit ] JS is a zero-index languag . run-tim environ javascript typic reli on a run-tim environ ( e.g. , a web browser ) to provid object and method by which script can interact with the environ ( e.g. , a web page dom ) . these environ are single-thread . javascript also reli on the run-tim environ to provid the abil to include/import script ( e.g. , html < script > element ) . thi is not a languag featur per se , but it is common in most javascript implement . javascript process messag from a queue one at a time . javascript call a function associ with each new messag , creat a call stack frame with the function 's argument and local variabl . the call stack shrink and grow base on the function 's need . when the call stack is empti upon function complet , javascript proce to the next messag in the queue . thi is call the event loop , describ as `` run to complet '' becaus each messag is fulli process befor the next messag is consid . howev , the languag 's concurr model describ the event loop as non-block : program input/output is perform use event and callback function . thi mean , for instanc , that javascript can process a mous click while wait for a databas queri to return inform . [ 68 ] variad function An indefinit number of paramet can be pass to a function . the function can access them through formal paramet and also through the local argument object . variad function can also be creat by use the bind method . array and object liter like mani script languag , array and object ( associ array in other languag ) can each be creat with a succinct shortcut syntax . In fact , these liter form the basi of the json data format . regular express javascript also support regular express in a manner similar to perl , which provid a concis and power syntax for text manipul that is more sophist than the built-in string function . [ 69 ] promis and async/await javascript support promis and async/await for handl asynchron oper . A built-in promis object provid function for handl promis and associ handler with an asynchron action 's eventu result . recent , combin method were introduc in the javascript specif , which allow develop to combin multipl javascript promis and do oper base on differ scenario . the method introduc are : promise.rac , promise.al , promise.allsettl and promise.ani . async/await allow an asynchron , non-block function to be structur in a way similar to an ordinari synchron function . asynchron , non-block code can be written , with minim overhead , structur similar to tradit synchron , block code . vendor-specif extens [ edit ] histor , some javascript engin support these non-standard featur : condit catch claus ( like java ) array comprehens and gener express ( like python ) concis function express ( function ( arg ) expr ; thi experiment syntax predat arrow function ) ecmascript for xml ( e4x ) , an extens that add nativ xml support to ecmascript ( unsupport in firefox sinc version 21 [ 70 ] ) syntax [ edit ] main articl : javascript syntax simpl exampl [ edit ] variabl in javascript can be defin use either the var , [ 71 ] let [ 72 ] or const [ 73 ] keyword . // declar a function-scop variabl name ` x ` , and implicitli assign the // special valu ` undefin ` to it . variabl without valu are automat // set to undefin . var x ; // variabl can be manual set to ` undefin ` like so var x2 = undefin ; // declar a block-scop variabl name ` y ` , and implicitli set it to // ` undefin ` . the ` let ` keyword wa introduc in ecmascript 2015. let y ; // declar a block-scop , un-reassign variabl name ` z ` , and set it to // a string liter . the ` const ` keyword wa also introduc in ecmascript 2015 , // and must be explicitli assign to . // the keyword ` const ` mean constant , henc the variabl can not be reassign // as the valu is ` constant ` . const z = `` thi valu can not be reassign ! `` ; // declar a variabl name ` mynumb ` , and assign a number liter ( the valu // ` 2 ` ) to it . let mynumb = 2 ; // reassign ` mynumb ` , set it to a string liter ( the valu ` `` foo '' ` ) . // javascript is a dynamically-typ languag , so thi is legal . mynumb = `` foo '' ; note the comment in the exampl abov , all of which were preced with two forward slash . there is no built-in input/output function in javascript ; the run-tim environ provid that . the ecmascript specif in edit 5.1 mention : [ 74 ] inde , there are no provis in thi specif for input of extern data or output of comput result . howev , most runtim environ have a consol object [ 75 ] that can be use to print output . here is a minimalist hello world program in javascript : console.log ( `` hello world ! `` ) ; A simpl recurs function : function factori ( n ) { if ( n === 0 ) return 1 ; // 0 ! = 1 return n * factori ( n - 1 ) ; } factori ( 3 ) ; // return 6 An anonym function ( or lambda ) : function counter ( ) { let count = 0 ; return function ( ) { return ++count ; } ; } let x = counter ( ) ; x ( ) ; // return 1 x ( ) ; // return 2 x ( ) ; // return 3 thi exampl show that , in javascript , function closur captur their non-loc variabl by refer . arrow function were first introduc in 6th edit - ecmascript 2015 . they shorten the syntax for write function in javascript . arrow function are anonym , so a variabl is need to refer to them in order to invok them after their creation . exampl of arrow function : // arrow function let us omit the ` function ` keyword . // here ` long_exampl ` point to an anonym function valu . const long_exampl = ( input1 , input2 ) = > { console.log ( `` hello , world ! `` ) ; const output = input1 + input2 ; return output ; } ; // If there are no brace , the arrow function simpli return the express // So here it 's ( input1 + input2 ) const short_exampl = ( input1 , input2 ) = > input1 + input2 ; long_exampl ( 2 , 3 ) ; // print `` hello , world !

[ 80 ] content secur polici is the main intend method of ensur that onli trust code is execut on a web page . cross-sit vulner [ edit ] main articl : cross-sit script and cross-sit request forgeri A common javascript-rel secur problem is cross-sit script ( xss ) , a violat of the same-origin polici . xss vulner occur when an attack can caus a target web site , such as an onlin bank websit , to includ a malici script in the webpag present to a victim . the script in thi exampl can then access the bank applic with the privileg of the victim , potenti disclos secret inform or transfer money without the victim 's author . A solut to xss vulner is to use html escap whenev display untrust data . some browser includ partial protect against reflect xss attack , in which the attack provid a url includ malici script . howev , even user of those browser are vulner to other xss attack , such as those where the malici code is store in a databas . onli correct design of web applic on the server-sid can fulli prevent xss . xss vulner can also occur becaus of implement mistak by browser author . [ 81 ] anoth cross-sit vulner is cross-sit request forgeri ( csrf ) . In csrf , code on an attack 's site trick the victim 's browser into take action the user did not intend at a target site ( like transfer money at a bank ) . when target site reli sole on cooki for request authent , request origin from code on the attack 's site can carri the same valid login credenti of the initi user . In gener , the solut to csrf is to requir an authent valu in a hidden form field , and not onli in the cooki , to authent ani request that might have last effect . check the http referr header can also help . `` javascript hijack '' is a type of csrf attack in which a < script > tag on an attack 's site exploit a page on the victim 's site that return privat inform such as json or javascript . possibl solut includ : requir an authent token in the post and get paramet for ani respons that return privat inform . misplac trust in the client [ edit ] develop of client-serv applic must recogn that untrust client may be under the control of attack . the applic author can not assum that their javascript code will run as intend ( or at all ) becaus ani secret embed in the code could be extract by a determin adversari . some implic are : web site author can not perfectli conceal how their javascript oper becaus the raw sourc code must be sent to the client . the code can be obfusc , but obfusc can be reverse-engin . javascript form valid onli provid conveni for user , not secur . If a site verifi that the user agre to it term of servic , or filter invalid charact out of field that should onli contain number , it must do so on the server , not onli the client . script can be select disabl , so javascript can not be reli on to prevent oper such as right-click on an imag to save it . [ 82 ] It is consid veri bad practic to emb sensit inform such as password in javascript becaus it can be extract by an attack . [ 83 ] misplac trust in develop [ edit ] packag manag system such as npm and bower are popular with javascript develop . such system allow a develop to easili manag their program 's depend upon other develop ' program librari . develop trust that the maintain of the librari will keep them secur and up to date , but that is not alway the case . A vulner ha emerg becaus of thi blind trust . relied-upon librari can have new releas that caus bug or vulner to appear in all program that reli upon the librari . invers , a librari can go unpatch with known vulner out in the wild . In a studi done look over a sampl of 133k websit , research found 37 % of the websit includ a librari with at least one known vulner . [ 84 ] `` the median lag between the oldest librari version use on each websit and the newest avail version of that librari is 1,177 day in alexa , and develop of some librari still in activ use ceas year ago . `` [ 84 ] anoth possibl is that the maintain of a librari may remov the librari entir . thi occur in march 2016 when azer koã§ulu remov hi repositori from npm . thi caus ten of thousand of program and websit depend upon hi librari to break . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] browser and plugin code error [ edit ] javascript provid an interfac to a wide rang of browser capabl , some of which may have flaw such as buffer overflow . these flaw can allow attack to write script that would run ani code they wish on the user 's system . thi code is not by ani mean limit to anoth javascript applic . for exampl , a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attack to gain access to the oper system 's api with superus privileg . these flaw have affect major browser includ firefox , [ 87 ] internet explor , [ 88 ] and safari . [ 89 ] plugin , such as video player , adob flash , and the wide rang of activex control enabl by default in microsoft internet explor , may also have flaw exploit via javascript ( such flaw have been exploit in the past ) . [ 90 ] [ 91 ] In window vista , microsoft ha attempt to contain the risk of bug such as buffer overflow by run the internet explor process with limit privileg . [ 92 ] googl chrome similarli confin it page render to their own `` sandbox '' . sandbox implement error [ edit ] web browser are capabl of run javascript outsid the sandbox , with the privileg necessari to , for exampl , creat or delet file . such privileg are not intend to be grant to code from the web . incorrectli grant privileg to javascript from the web ha play a role in vulner in both internet explor [ 93 ] and firefox . [ 94 ] In window XP servic pack 2 , microsoft demot jscript 's privileg in internet explor . [ 95 ] microsoft window allow javascript sourc file on a comput 's hard drive to be launch as general-purpos , non-sandbox program ( see : window script host ) . thi make javascript ( like vbscript ) a theoret viabl vector for a trojan hors , although javascript trojan hors are uncommon in practic . [ 96 ] [ fail verif ] hardwar vulner [ edit ] In 2015 , a javascript-bas proof-of-concept implement of a rowhamm attack wa describ in a paper by secur research .

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] mani text editor have syntax highlight support for javascript code . relat technolog [ edit ] java [ edit ] A common misconcept is that javascript is the same as java . both inde have a c-like syntax ( the C languag be their most immedi common ancestor languag ) . they are also typic sandbox ( when use insid a browser ) , and javascript wa design with java 's syntax and standard librari in mind . In particular , all java keyword were reserv in origin javascript , javascript 's standard librari follow java 's name convent , and javascript 's math and date object are base on class from java 1.0 . [ 106 ] java and javascript both first appear in 1995 , but java wa develop by jame gosl of sun microsystem and javascript by brendan eich of netscap commun . the differ between the two languag are more promin than their similar . java ha static type , while javascript 's type is dynam . java is load from compil bytecod , while javascript is load as human-read sourc code . java 's object are class-bas , while javascript 's are prototype-bas . final , java did not support function program until java 8 , while javascript ha done so from the begin , be influenc by scheme . json [ edit ] json , or javascript object notat , is a general-purpos data interchang format that is defin as a subset of javascript 's object liter syntax . webassembl [ edit ] sinc 2017 , web browser have support webassembl , a binari format that enabl a javascript engin to execut performance-crit portion of web page script close to nativ speed . [ 107 ] webassembl code run in the same sandbox as regular javascript code . asm.j is a subset of javascript that serv as the forerunn of webassembl .

      "JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\n",

      "Creation at Netscape[edit]\n",
      "The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]\n",
      "During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]\n",
      "Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]\n",
      "The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption by Microsoft[edit]\n",
      "Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]\n",
      "JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[21][22] These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos for several years.[21][23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of JScript[edit]\n",
      "In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\n",
      "The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]\n",
      "Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\n",
      "Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth and standardization[edit]\n",
      "During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[25]\n",
      "In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\n",
      "Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\n",
      "Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.[26][27] The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT),[28] so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.[29]\n",
      "In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching maturity[edit]\n",
      "Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]\n",
      "The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.[34]\n",
      "The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35] Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]\n",
      "The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.[38]\n",

      "\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.[39][40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Website client-side usage[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 97% of websites using it for this purpose.[12] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of scripted behavior[edit]\n",
      "Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.\n",
      "Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.\n",
      "Playing browser games.\n",
      "Controlling the playback of streaming media.\n",
      "Generating pop-up ads.\n",
      "Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.\n",
      "Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.\n",
      "Redirecting a user to another page.\n",
      "Libraries and frameworks[edit]\n",
      "Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.[13]\n",
      "jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites.[13] Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.[13]\n",
      "In contrast, the term \"Vanilla JS\" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other usage[edit]\n",
      "The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\n",
      "Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,[42][43] but they were small niches.[44] Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[44]\n",
      "Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents[45] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[46]\n",
      "JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.[47][48][49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Features[edit]\n",
      "The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperative and structured[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Weakly typed[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator\n",
      "The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number\n",
      "Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number\n",
      "Values are cast to strings like the following:[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings are left as-is\n",
      "Numbers are converted to their string representation\n",
      "Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)\n",
      "Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object\n",
      "Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.\n",
      "JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.[52][51] For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\n",

      "Often also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If you wrap the expression in parentheses ({} + []) the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is \"[object Object]\" as expected.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic[edit]\n",
      "Typing\n",
      "JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string.[53]  JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.[54]\n",
      "Run-time evaluation\n",
      "JavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n",
      "Object-orientation (prototype-based)[edit]\n",
      "Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\n",
      "\n",
      ".mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?[55]\n",
      "\n",
      "In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.x=10) and bracket notation (obj['x']=10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prototypes\n",
      "JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.[56] It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.[57]\n",
      "Functions as object constructors\n",
      "Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype).[58] ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null).[59] The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.[60]\n",
      "Functions as methods\n",
      "Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n",
      "Functional[edit]\n",
      "A function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object.[61] As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().[62] A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.[63] JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delegative[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Functions as roles (Traits and Mixins)\n",
      "JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role[64] patterns like Traits[65][66] and Mixins.[67] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n",
      "Object composition and inheritance\n",
      "Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n",
      "Miscellaneous[edit]\n",
      "JS is a zero-index language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Run-time environment\n",
      "JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a web browser) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment (e.g., a web page DOM). These environments are single-threaded. JavaScript also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts (e.g., HTML <script> elements). This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations. JavaScript processes messages from a queue one at a time. JavaScript calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as \"run to completion\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program input/output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.[68]\n",
      "Variadic functions\n",
      "An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\n",
      "Array and object literals\n",
      "Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\n",
      "Regular expressions\n",
      "JavaScript also supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.[69]\n",
      "Promises and Async/await\n",
      "JavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations. A built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result. Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript specification, which allows developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any. Async/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similar to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\n",
      "Vendor-specific extensions[edit]\n",
      "Historically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:\n",
      "\n",
      "conditional catch clauses (like Java)\n",

      "See also: Browser security\n",
      "JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n",
      "There are subsets of general JavaScriptADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).[78][79] Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.[80]\n",
      "Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-site vulnerabilities[edit]\n",
      "Main articles: Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery\n",
      "A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use HTML escaping whenever displaying untrusted data.\n",
      "Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.\n",
      "XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.[81]\n",
      "Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n",
      "\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a <script> tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.\n",
      "Misplaced trust in the client[edit]\n",
      "Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.\n",
      "JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.\n",
      "Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.[82]\n",
      "It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.[83]\n",
      "Misplaced trust in developers[edit]\n",
      "Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability.[84] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\"[84] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.[85][86]\n",

      "Browser and plugin coding errors[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.\n",
      "These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox,[87] Internet Explorer,[88] and Safari.[89]\n",
      "Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).[90][91]\n",
      "In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges.[92] Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own \"sandbox\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandbox implementation errors[edit]\n",
      "Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\n",
      "Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer[93] and Firefox.[94] In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer.[95]\n",
      "Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.[96][failed verification]\n",

      "Related technologies[edit]\n",
      "Java[edit]\n",
      "A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java.  Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.[106]\n",
      "Java and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\n",
      "The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\n",

      "WebAssembly[edit]\n",
      "Since 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance-critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed.[107] WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\n",

      "Creation at Netscape[edit]\n",
      "The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]\n",
      "During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]\n",
      "Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]\n",
      "The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption by Microsoft[edit]\n",
      "Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]\n",
      "JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[21][22] These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos for several years.[21][23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of JScript[edit]\n",
      "In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\n",
      "The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]\n",
      "Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\n",
      "Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth and standardization[edit]\n",
      "During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[25]\n",
      "In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\n",
      "Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\n",
      "Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.[26][27] The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT),[28] so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.[29]\n",
      "In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching maturity[edit]\n",
      "Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]\n",
      "The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.[34]\n",
      "The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35] Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]\n",
      "The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trademark[edit]\n",
      "\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.[39][40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Website client-side usage[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 97% of websites using it for this purpose.[12] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of scripted behavior[edit]\n",
      "Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.\n",
      "Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.\n",
      "Playing browser games.\n",
      "Controlling the playback of streaming media.\n",
      "Generating pop-up ads.\n",
      "Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.\n",
      "Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.\n",
      "Redirecting a user to another page.\n",
      "Libraries and frameworks[edit]\n",
      "Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.[13]\n",
      "jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites.[13] Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.[13]\n",
      "In contrast, the term \"Vanilla JS\" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other usage[edit]\n",
      "The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\n",
      "Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,[42][43] but they were small niches.[44] Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[44]\n",
      "Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents[45] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[46]\n",
      "JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.[47][48][49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Features[edit]\n",
      "The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperative and structured[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Weakly typed[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator\n",
      "The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number\n",
      "Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number\n",
      "Values are cast to strings like the following:[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings are left as-is\n",
      "Numbers are converted to their string representation\n",
      "Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)\n",
      "Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object\n",
      "Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.\n",
      "JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.[52][51] For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\n",

      "Often also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If you wrap the expression in parentheses ({} + []) the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is \"[object Object]\" as expected.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic[edit]\n",
      "Typing\n",
      "JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string.[53]  JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.[54]\n",
      "Run-time evaluation\n",
      "JavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n",
      "Object-orientation (prototype-based)[edit]\n",
      "Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\n",
      "\n",
      "You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?[55]\n",
      "\n",
      "In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.xÂ =Â 10) and bracket notation (obj['x']Â =Â 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prototypes\n",
      "JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.[56] It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.[57]\n",
      "Functions as object constructors\n",
      "Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype).[58] ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null).[59] The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.[60]\n",
      "Functions as methods\n",
      "Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n",
      "Functional[edit]\n",
      "A function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object.[61] As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().[62] A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.[63] JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delegative[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Functions as roles (Traits and Mixins)\n",
      "JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role[64] patterns like Traits[65][66] and Mixins.[67] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n",
      "Object composition and inheritance\n",
      "Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n",
      "Miscellaneous[edit]\n",
      "JS is a zero-index language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Run-time environment\n",
      "JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a web browser) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment (e.g., a web page DOM). These environments are single-threaded. JavaScript also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts (e.g., HTML <script> elements). This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations. JavaScript processes messages from a queue one at a time. JavaScript calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as \"run to completion\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program input/output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.[68]\n",
      "Variadic functions\n",
      "An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\n",
      "Array and object literals\n",
      "Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\n",
      "Regular expressions\n",
      "JavaScript also supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.[69]\n",
      "Promises and Async/await\n",
      "JavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations. A built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result. Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript specification, which allows developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any. Async/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similar to traditional synchronous, blocking code.\n",

First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n",
      "There are subsets of general JavaScriptâADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)âthat provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).[78][79] Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.[80]\n",

      "Main articles: Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery\n",
      "A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use HTML escaping whenever displaying untrusted data.\n",
      "Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.\n",
      "XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.[81]\n",
      "Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n",
      "\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a <script> tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\n",

      "requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.\n",
      "Misplaced trust in the client[edit]\n",
      "Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers.

Some implications are:\n",

      "Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.\n",
      "JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.\n",
      "Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.[82]\n",
      "It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.[83]\n",
      "Misplaced trust in developers[edit]\n",
      "Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability.[84] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\"[84] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer KoÃ§ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.[85][86]\n",
      "\n",
      "Browser and plugin coding errors[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.\n",
      "These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox,[87] Internet Explorer,[88] and Safari.[89]\n",
      "Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).[90][91]\n",
      "In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges.[92] Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own \"sandbox\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandbox implementation errors[edit]\n",
      "Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\n",
      "Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer[93] and Firefox.[94] In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer.[95]\n",
      "Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.[96][failed verification]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardware vulnerabilities[edit]\n",
      "In 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.[97][98][99][100]\n",
      "In 2017, a JavaScript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It's called \"ASLRâCache\" or AnC.[101][102]\n",
      "In 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.[103]\n",
      "\n",
      "Development tools[edit]\n",
      "Important tools have evolved with the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger.\n",
      "Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines.\n",
      "Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.[104][105]\n",
      "Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.\n",
      "Related technologies[edit]\n",
      "Java[edit]\n",
      "A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java.  Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.[106]\n",
      "Java and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\n",
      "The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "JSON[edit]\n",
      "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "WebAssembly[edit]\n",
      "Since 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance-critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed.[107] WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\n",
      "asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.[108]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Transpilers[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is the dominant client-side language of the Web, and many websites are script-heavy. Thus transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.[38]\n",

      "History[edit]\n",
      "Creation at Netscape[edit]\n",
      "The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]\n",
      "During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]\n",
      "Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]\n",
      "The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption by Microsoft[edit]\n",
      "Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]\n",
      "JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[21][22] These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos for several years.[21][23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of JScript[edit]\n",
      "In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\n",
      "The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]\n",
      "Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\n",
      "Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth and standardization[edit]\n",
      "During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[25]\n",
      "In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\n",
      "Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\n",
      "Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.[26][27] The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT),[28] so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.[29]\n",
      "In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching maturity[edit]\n",
      "Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]\n",
      "The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.[34]\n",
      "The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35] Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]\n",
      "The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trademark[edit]\n",
      "\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.[39][40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Website client-side usage[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 97% of websites using it for this purpose.[12] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of scripted behavior[edit]\n",
      "Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.\n",
      "Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.\n",
      "Playing browser games.\n",
      "Controlling the playback of streaming media.\n",
      "Generating pop-up ads.\n",
      "Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.\n",
      "Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.\n",
      "Redirecting a user to another page.\n",
      "Libraries and frameworks[edit]\n",
      "Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.[13]\n",
      "jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites.[13] Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.[13]\n",
      "In contrast, the term \"Vanilla JS\" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other usage[edit]\n",
      "The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.\n",
      "Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,[42][43] but they were small niches.[44] Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[44]\n",
      "Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents[45] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[46]\n",
      "JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.[47][48][49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Features[edit]\n",
      "The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperative and structured[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Weakly typed[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator\n",
      "The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number\n",
      "Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number\n",
      "Values are cast to strings like the following:[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings are left as-is\n",
      "Numbers are converted to their string representation\n",
      "Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)\n",
      "Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object\n",
      "Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.\n",
      "JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency.[52][51] For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\n",

      "Often also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If you wrap the expression in parentheses ({} + []) the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is \"[object Object]\" as expected.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamic[edit]\n",
      "Typing\n",
      "JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string.[53]  JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.[54]\n",
      "Run-time evaluation\n",
      "JavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.\n",
      "Object-orientation (prototype-based)[edit]\n",
      "Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:\n",
      "\n",
      "You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?[55]\n",
      "\n",
      "In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (obj.xÂ =Â 10) and bracket notation (obj['x']Â =Â 10). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a for...in loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prototypes\n",
      "JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.[56] It is possible to simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.[57]\n",
      "Functions as object constructors\n",
      "Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object prototype).[58] ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to null).[59] The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.[60]\n",
      "Functions as methods\n",
      "Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.\n",
      "Functional[edit]\n",
      "A function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object.[61] As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call() and .bind().[62] A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.[63] JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delegative[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Functions as roles (Traits and Mixins)\n",
      "JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role[64] patterns like Traits[65][66] and Mixins.[67] Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.\n",
      "Object composition and inheritance\n",
      "Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.\n",
      "Miscellaneous[edit]\n",
      "JS is a zero-index language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Run-time environment\n",
      "JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a web browser) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment (e.g., a web page DOM). These environments are single-threaded. JavaScript also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts (e.g., HTML  elements). This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations. JavaScript processes messages from a queue one at a time. JavaScript calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as \"run to completion\" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program input/output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.[68]\n",
      "Variadic functions\n",
      "An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.\n",
      "Array and object literals\n",
      "Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.\n",
      "Regular expressions\n",
      "JavaScript also supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.[69]\n",
      "Promises and Async/await\n",
      "JavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations. A built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result. Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript specification, which allows developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any. Async/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function.

First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\n",
      "There are subsets of general JavaScriptâADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)âthat provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements).[78][79] Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.[80]\n",
      "Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross-site vulnerabilities[edit]\n",
      "Main articles: Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery\n",
      "A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use HTML escaping whenever displaying untrusted data.\n",
      "Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.\n",
      "XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.[81]\n",
      "Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n",
      "\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a  tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.\n",
      "Misplaced trust in the client[edit]\n",
      "Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.\n",
      "JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.\n",
      "Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.[82]\n",
      "It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.[83]\n",
      "Misplaced trust in developers[edit]\n",
      "Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability.[84] \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\"[84] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer KoÃ§ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.[85][86]\n",

      "Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.[104][105]\n",
      "Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.\n",
      "Related technologies[edit]\n",
      "Java[edit]\n",
      "A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java.  Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.[106]\n",
      "Java and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\n",
      "The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "JSON[edit]\n",
      "JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "WebAssembly[edit]\n",
      "Since 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance-critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed.[107] WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\n",
      "asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.[108]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Transpilers[edit]\n",
      "JavaScript is the dominant client-side language of the Web, and many websites are script-heavy. Thus transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.[38]\n",
